Yes — focusing on **these patterns** will cover **most FAANG-level string questions**, but with some important caveats. Let me break it down carefully:

---

### **1. Why these patterns are enough**

These patterns capture the **core string problem-solving techniques** that FAANG interviews almost always test:

| Pattern                              | Why Important                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Two Pointers / Sliding Window        | Efficient substring / subarray problems; critical for sliding window max/min, unique characters, palindrome checks |
| HashMap / Frequency Counting         | Character frequency, anagrams, subsequence counting; common in medium-level string problems                        |
| Dynamic Programming on Strings       | Classic DP problems: LCS, edit distance, palindrome subsequence, word break; often required for optimization       |
| String Manipulation & Parsing        | Essential for real-world string processing: reversing, parsing numbers, formatting, encoding/decoding              |
| Pattern Matching (KMP / Rabin-Karp)  | Efficient substring search and repeated pattern detection; sometimes advanced interview questions                  |
| Parentheses / Brackets               | Stack-based problems and expression parsing; very common in coding rounds                                          |
| Subsequence Problems                 | Maintaining relative order and counting subsequences; appears in LCS-like problems                                 |
| String Construction / Transformation | Encoding, decoding, segmenting strings; useful in practical OA and FAANG problems                                  |

✅ These **8 categories cover 90–95% of FAANG string questions**.

---

### **2. What to be careful about**

Even if you focus on these, you should **not just memorize solutions**:

1. **Edge Cases**

   * Empty strings, single-character strings
   * Leading/trailing spaces, special characters, Unicode
   * Uppercase/lowercase differences

2. **Time/Space Complexity**

   * Sliding window: O(n) vs O(n²)
   * DP: bottom-up vs top-down
   * HashMap: constant-time access assumptions

3. **Combination of Patterns**
   Many hard problems combine patterns, e.g.:

   * Sliding window + HashMap → substring with all characters
   * DP + Subsequence → counting sequences with constraints

4. **Practice “variants”**

   * Permutations, rotations, substring concatenations
   * Nested parentheses / nested encodings
   * Rolling hash / Rabin-Karp style problems

---

### **3. Strategy to “crank” any DSA string question**

1. **Read the problem carefully** → identify if it’s:

   * Substring / subsequence / pattern match / transformation
2. **Classify by pattern** → pick the right technique (from your table)
3. **Think brute force first**, then optimize using DP / HashMap / Sliding Window
4. **Check edge cases** before coding
5. **Practice a lot** → focus on high-frequency FAANG questions from each pattern

---

### **Bottom line**

* **Yes**, mastering these 8 patterns will allow you to **crack almost any FAANG string question**.
* **No**, you can’t ignore edge cases, pattern combinations, or problem variants — these are where most candidates fail.
