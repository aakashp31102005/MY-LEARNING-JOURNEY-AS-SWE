‚úÖ Now you can clearly see which areas you‚Äôve **covered well (arrays, SQL, strings, recursion)** and which are **lighter (advanced DP, graph algorithms, advanced recursion/backtracking like N-Queens, Sudoku, etc.)**.

---

Do you want me to next:

1. Highlight **which important recursion patterns are still missing** from your solved list,
2. Or build you a **roadmap of ‚Äúmust-solve next‚Äù recursion problems** to fill those gaps?
