Ah got it! You want the **same content but organized in bullet points**, grouped **topic-wise**, rather than in tables. Perfect for pasting into notes or Notion in a cleaner, more readable way. Here's the full structure for you:

---

## ✅ **Must-Know Core Tools for a Java Developer (Real-World Ready)**

- **Spring Boot**: For building stand-alone, production-grade backend applications.  
- **Spring Data JPA**: Simplifies interaction with relational databases using Object Relational Mapping (ORM).
- **Hibernate**: The ORM tool that Spring Data JPA uses under the hood.
- **Maven / Gradle**: Build tools used to manage dependencies and compile Java projects.
- **Lombok**: Reduces boilerplate code like getters, setters, constructors, etc.
- **Spring Boot DevTools** *(Optional)*: Enables hot reloading and improves development workflow.

---

## 🌱 **Other Commonly Used Tools & Libraries (Based on Project Needs)**

### 🔒 **Security & Authentication**
- **Spring Security**: Provides login, authorization, and secure access control.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: Used for stateless, token-based user authentication in REST APIs.

---

### 🌐 **Web & API Utilities**
- **Spring Web / Spring MVC**: Helps create RESTful web services and web applications.
- **Swagger / Springdoc-OpenAPI**: Automatically generates API documentation for your REST APIs.
- **Postman / Curl**: Tools for testing APIs and HTTP requests/responses manually.

---

### 💾 **Database & Persistence**
- **H2 Database**: Lightweight, in-memory database commonly used during development.
- **PostgreSQL / MySQL**: Relational databases widely used in production environments.
- **Flyway / Liquibase**: Tools to handle version control and migration of your database schema.

---

### 🧪 **Testing & Validation**
- **JUnit 5**: Primary framework for writing and running unit tests in Java.
- **Mockito**: Used to create mock objects for unit testing.
- **AssertJ / Hamcrest**: Libraries for writing fluent and expressive test assertions.
- **Bean Validation (JSR 380)**: Validation API using annotations like `@NotNull`, `@Size`, etc.

---

### 🔄 **Object Mapping**
- **MapStruct**: Generates type-safe, fast mappers for converting between DTOs and entities at compile time.
- **ModelMapper**: Flexible object mapping at runtime (slower than MapStruct, but dynamic).

---

### ☁️ **Containerization & Deployment**
- **Docker**: Allows packaging your app with its environment into containers for easier deployment.
- **Kubernetes** *(Optional)*: Container orchestration tool used in large-scale systems.
- **Heroku / AWS / Render**: Cloud platforms for deploying Java (Spring Boot) applications.

---

### 🧵 **Concurrency & Reactive Programming**
- **ExecutorService**: Core Java utility for handling multithreaded tasks.
- **Spring WebFlux**: A reactive, non-blocking framework built for high-performance REST APIs.
- **Project Reactor**: Core library used in Spring WebFlux for handling reactive streams.

---

## ✅ **Summary – Minimum Stack for Java Backend Developer**

- **Backend Framework**: Spring Boot
- **ORM & DB**: Hibernate + Spring Data JPA
- **Build Tool**: Maven or Gradle
- **Code Cleaner**: Lombok
- **Database**: H2 for development, PostgreSQL or MySQL for production
- **Security**: Spring Security + JWT (for secured APIs)
- **Testing**: JUnit + Mockito
